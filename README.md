Really good list of problem solving techniques!

**<ins>Update (Sat. 1/15/23; 5:06 PM EST)</ins>**: I haven't updated this README.md in a really long time. But I did really well this winter break with respect to LeetCode. I finished the `SQL I Study Plan` and an half way through the `Binary Search I Study Plan`. I'm going to pick things up again after my classes are done.
* For the `Binary Search I Study Plan`, I need to pick things back up on problem **1337**.
* I have to learn more about <ins>*time and space complexity*</ins> this year for sure. This is an area that I have basically neglected and will have to keep trying. 
Even though I'm not very good at LeetCode, I do find that I enjoy it you know? I find doing LeetCode problems interesting and pretty fun. This is a sign that I should stay with engineering for sure. I enjoy the process and the struggle; I enjoy solving problems no matter how long it takes. I think that's a sign for me to keep grinding and staying with engineering.

**<ins>Update (6/5/21)</ins>**: This is a repository that has all the scripts that I'm working on when I'm hacking on random things. This is mostly for learning purposes and really just a way for me to curate and organize files/resources that I may need in the future. - Yingquan
