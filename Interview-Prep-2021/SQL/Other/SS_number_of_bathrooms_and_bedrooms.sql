-- TRICKS:
-- We are told: "Find the average number of bathrooms and bedrooms for each cityâ€™s property types."
-- This means we have to do a GROUP BY operation with 'city,property_type'!

SELECT
    city,
    property_type,
    AVG(bathrooms) AS avg_bathrooms,
    AVG(bedrooms) AS avg_bedrooms
FROM airbnb_search_details
GROUP BY city,property_type;
